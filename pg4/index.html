                    <h2>Who I am</h2>
                    was born in 1977, the year that punk rock and Star Wars came to life, and I was raised on both. I guess that explains a certain 'rebel streak' rather well.

                    I love to ride my (fixed gear) bike and the feeling of complete freedom while racing across one of Hamburg's countless bridges or down a mountain road in a faraway country.
                                       
                    I'm also trying to fall in love with running at the moment.
